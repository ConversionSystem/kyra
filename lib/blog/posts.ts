<p>Most GHL agencies have the same problem: you charge a setup fee, maybe a retainer, and then the relationship goes quiet. The client stops replying. Revenue stagnates.</p>

<p>There's a simple fix. And it's worth $1,000–$2,000/month per client.</p>

<h2>What is an AI Employee?</h2>

<p>An AI employee is an autonomous AI agent that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Responds to every inbound SMS in under 60 seconds — 24/7</li>
  <li>Books appointments by checking availability and confirming times</li>
  <li>Updates GHL CRM with tags and notes after every conversation</li>
  <li>Detects frustrated customers and escalates to your human team instantly</li>
  <li>Handles opt-outs, business hours, and multi-channel messages automatically</li>
</ul>

<p>It's not a chatbot. It's not a canned response bot. It's a real AI that understands context, remembers conversation history, and operates like a trained employee — except it never sleeps, never takes a vacation, and never calls in sick.</p>

<h2>Why GHL Agencies Are Perfectly Positioned</h2>

<p>You already have the infrastructure. GHL gives you the CRM, the pipelines, the phone numbers, and the messaging channels. An AI employee like Kyra plugs directly into your existing GHL setup using a Private Integration Token — no OAuth approval, no marketplace hurdles.</p>

<p>The moment your client adds their GHL token, the AI starts monitoring their conversations and responding automatically. Setup takes about 10 minutes. The AI goes live immediately.</p>

<h2>The Pricing Model That Works</h2>

<p>Most agencies bill their AI employees as a retainer:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Local service businesses</strong> (dental, HVAC, fitness): $500–$1,000/month</li>
  <li><strong>High-ticket service businesses</strong> (real estate, law, med spa): $1,000–$3,000/month</li>
  <li><strong>Volume businesses</strong> (cannabis, auto, restaurant): $500–$2,000/month</li>
</ul>

<p>The pitch is simple: "Your AI employee responds to every lead in 60 seconds, books appointments, and updates your CRM — while you sleep. If it books one extra appointment per week, it's paid for itself."</p>

<p>For a dental practice at $150/cleaning, three extra bookings per week = $450/week = $1,800/month. You charge $800. They're ahead.</p>

<h2>How to Get Your First Client Live</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Sign up for Kyra</strong> — free account at kyra.conversionsystem.com</li>
  <li><strong>Add the client</strong> — pick an industry template (dental, real estate, auto, etc.)</li>
  <li><strong>Connect GHL</strong> — add the client's Private Integration Token (from their GHL Settings → Integrations)</li>
  <li><strong>Customize the personality</strong> — or click "Generate with AI" to auto-write the AI's persona in seconds</li>
  <li><strong>Go live</strong> — the AI starts responding within 60 seconds</li>
</ol>

<p>The whole process takes under 10 minutes. The AI does the rest.</p>

<h2>Scaling to 10+ Clients</h2>

<p>Once you have your first AI employee live and your client sees results, scaling is straightforward. Every new client follows the same 5-step process. The AI personalities are different, the channels might vary, but the infrastructure is the same.</p>

<p>At 10 clients charging $800/month each: $8,000/month in recurring revenue. At 20 clients: $16,000/month. Kyra Pro handles 15 clients at $247/month — your gross margin is 97% before API costs.</p>

<h2>The Competitive Moat</h2>

<p>Once your client's AI employee is live and working, they won't want to turn it off. The AI builds up conversation history, learns the business's tone, and becomes genuinely useful over time. Churn on a working AI employee is near zero.</p>

<p>Every booking it makes, every lead it handles, every CRM update it logs — that's value your client can see. It's not abstract "automation." It's results they can count.</p>

    title: 'AI for Dental Practices: How It Works, What It Does, and What to Expect',
    description: 'Dental practices lose thousands in missed appointments and unanswered after-hours inquiries every month. AI employees change that — here\'s exactly how.',

<p>Dental practices have a lead problem that most dentists don't realize: their phones go unanswered.</p>

<p>A patient texts at 7pm asking about a cleaning. The office is closed. By morning, they've booked with another practice. That's $150 lost on a cleaning — potentially $2,000+ if they become a regular patient.</p>

<p>An AI employee fixes this problem permanently.</p>

<h2>What the Dental AI Employee Does</h2>

<p>When a patient texts your practice's GHL number, the AI responds within 60 seconds — day or night. It:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Answers questions about pricing, services, and insurance</li>
  <li>Books appointments by offering available time slots</li>
  <li>Handles insurance questions ("Do you take Delta Dental?" — yes, with most major plans)</li>
  <li>Sends appointment confirmations and preparation instructions</li>
  <li>Follows up with no-shows</li>
  <li>Tags the contact in GHL (new patient, appointment requested, insurance verified, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>It does all of this automatically, without staff involvement, 24 hours a day.</p>

<h2>A Real Example</h2>

<p>Here's an actual conversation a dental AI employee handles:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Patient:</strong> Hi, I need a cleaning. How much does it cost?</p>
<p><strong>Kyra AI:</strong> Hi! 😊 A routine cleaning is $150, or fully covered with most insurance. We're accepting new patients — want to book?</p>
<p><strong>Patient:</strong> Yes! Do you have anything this week?</p>
<p><strong>Kyra AI:</strong> Tuesday at 2pm or Thursday at 10am. Which works? And which insurance do you have?</p>
<p><strong>Patient:</strong> Tuesday works. I have Delta Dental.</p>
<p><strong>Kyra AI:</strong> ✅ Reserved! Tuesday 2pm, Smile Dental. With Delta Dental you're fully covered. Confirmation text coming tomorrow morning!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This conversation happened at 9:30pm. Without the AI, that patient sends a text to a closed practice and books elsewhere in the morning. With the AI, they're booked before they go to sleep.</p>

<h2>What About HIPAA?</h2>

<p>The AI doesn't access or store patient medical records. It handles scheduling and basic inquiries — the same type of communication a front desk receptionist would have via text. However, your practice should review AI communications with your compliance officer to ensure alignment with your specific policies.</p>

<h2>Integration With GoHighLevel</h2>

<p>If your practice uses GoHighLevel (or you're a marketing agency that manages their GHL account), the AI employee integrates directly. It:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reads and responds to GHL SMS conversations</li>
  <li>Tags contacts automatically (new-patient, appointment-scheduled, insurance-verified)</li>
  <li>Moves contacts through your pipeline stages</li>
  <li>Writes notes after every conversation</li>
  <li>Escalates urgent situations immediately</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to Expect in the First Week</h2>

<p>Most dental practices see results within 48 hours of going live. The AI starts catching inquiries that would have otherwise gone unanswered. Typical outcomes in the first 30 days:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3–8 new patient appointments booked from after-hours inquiries</li>
  <li>Significant reduction in "quick question" calls during business hours</li>
  <li>100% response rate on new patient inquiries</li>
</ul>

    title: 'How Agencies Add $10,000/Month in Recurring Revenue with AI Employees',
    description: 'The math is simple: 10 clients × $1,000/month = $10K MRR at ~97% gross margin. Here\'s the exact playbook to get there in 90 days.',
    date: '2026-02-22',

<p>Most digital marketing agencies have a ceiling problem. You can only take on so many clients. Every new client means more work, more management, more headaches. Revenue grows linearly. Costs grow almost as fast.</p>

<p>AI employees break this model. Here's why: the marginal cost of adding a 15th AI employee is almost zero. You configure a personality, connect GHL, and the AI does the rest. The infrastructure scales automatically. You don't hire more staff. You don't increase overhead.</p>

<p>That's the opportunity.</p>

<h2>The Math</h2>

<p>Let's run the numbers on a basic agency AI operation:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Platform cost:</strong> $247/month (Kyra Pro, up to 15 AI employees)</li>
  <li><strong>API cost:</strong> ~$1–3/client/month at moderate conversation volume</li>
  <li><strong>Your price to clients:</strong> $800–$1,500/month per AI employee</li>
  <li><strong>10 clients at $1,000/month:</strong> $10,000 MRR</li>
  <li><strong>Your costs:</strong> ~$290/month (platform + API)</li>
  <li><strong>Gross margin:</strong> ~97%</li>
</ul>

<p>At 15 clients — Kyra Pro capacity — you're at $15,000/month with essentially no marginal cost increase.</p>

<h2>The 90-Day Playbook</h2>

<h3>Days 1–14: Foundation</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Sign up for Kyra at kyra.conversionsystem.com</li>
  <li>Set up a demo AI employee in your own agency's name (dental or real estate work great)</li>
  <li>Get comfortable with the dashboard: adding clients, customizing personalities, viewing conversations</li>
  <li>Use the Pitch Generator to create shareable demo links for 3 industries you know well</li>
</ol>

<h3>Days 15–30: First Client</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Pick your easiest existing client — probably someone you talk to regularly who trusts you</li>
  <li>Show them a live demo using their industry's pitch page</li>
  <li>Offer a 30-day trial at $0 (or a reduced rate) to prove the value</li>
  <li>Get them live on Kyra, connect their GHL, customize their personality</li>
  <li>Let the AI run for 2 weeks and review the results together</li>
</ol>

<h3>Days 31–60: Three Paying Clients</h3>

<p>With one live success story, the sell becomes much easier. Now you have a real example: "My client John at ABC Dental had 5 appointments booked by the AI in the first week." That's all you need.</p>

<p>Use the pitch pages and the live demo to show prospects. The demo does the heavy lifting — most people are convinced after 3 minutes of watching the AI respond.</p>

<h3>Days 61–90: Scale to $10K MRR</h3>

<p>By day 60, you should have 3–5 paying clients. The system is running itself. Now you systematize:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use the Business in a Box templates for cold emails and LinkedIn outreach</li>
  <li>Set up the referral program — give existing clients a free month for every referral that converts</li>
  <li>Expand within existing clients: if you have a dental practice, ask if they have partner practices</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who to Target First</h2>

<p>The best first prospects are businesses that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Receive high volumes of repetitive text inquiries (pricing, hours, availability)</li>
  <li>Have staff time wasted on simple Q&A</li>
  <li>Miss leads after hours</li>
  <li>Are already in GHL (or you can get them there)</li>
</ul>

<p>Best industries for fast results: dental, real estate, auto dealerships, cannabis dispensaries, restaurants, med spas, and fitness studios.</p>

<h2>The Retention Play</h2>

<p>Here's the best part: AI employee churn is nearly zero. Once it's live and working, clients don't want to turn it off. The AI builds up institutional knowledge — it knows the business's tone, the common questions, the pipeline stages. Replacing it means starting over.</p>

<p>Compare this to typical agency services where clients churn after 3–6 months. An AI employee that books appointments and handles leads creates ongoing, measurable value that compounds over time.</p>
